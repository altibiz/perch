# Packages

Packages are declared via the `flake.packages` option. Packages can also be
declared via the `integrate.packages` option if you want Perch to take care of
constructing `pkgs` for you. You can configure the default package via the
`seal.defaults.package` option for packages configured via `integrate.packages`.
